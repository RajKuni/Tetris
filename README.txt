An implementation of Tetris using SDL2.0. I wrote this program to learn C++ and the SDL library. The code is pretty messy
because I overcomplicated many simple things. Lots of hard-coded values too. Got pretty bored of working on this. Might
come back later to clean it up or add new features (like a scoreboard... : /).
